## main.py
1. Setting Up the Game Window:
   - The game window is created using the `Screen` class from the Turtle module.
   - The window has a black background and dimensions of 800x600 pixels.

2. Creating Paddles and Ball:
   - Two paddles (`r_paddle` and `l_paddle`) and a ball are created using the `Paddle` and `Ball` classes, respectively.
   - The paddles are positioned on the right and left sides of the screen.

3. Setting Up the Scoreboard:
   - A scoreboard (`scoreboard`) is created using the `Scoreboard` class.

4. Setting Up Controls:
   - Event listeners are set up to respond to keyboard inputs.
   - The right paddle moves up and down in response to the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys.
   - The left paddle moves up and down in response to the "w" and "s" keys.

5. Game Loop:
   - The game enters into a continuous loop (`while game_is_on`) to keep updating the game state.

6. Updating Screen:
   - The `screen.update()` method is called to refresh the screen and display the changes.

7. Moving the Ball:
   - The `ball.move()` method is called to update the position of the ball.

8. Collision Detection:
   - Collision with the top and bottom walls is detected, and the ball's y-direction is adjusted accordingly (`ball.bounce_y()`).

   - Collision with the paddles is detected, and the ball's x-direction is adjusted accordingly (`ball.bounce_x()`).

9. Scoring:
   - If the ball passes the right paddle (exceeds the x-coordinate of 380), the left player scores a point, and the ball is reset. The left player's score is updated using `scoreboard.l_point()`.

   - If the ball passes the left paddle (falls below the x-coordinate of -380), the right player scores a point, and the ball is reset. The right player's score is updated using `scoreboard.r_point()`.

10. Game Termination:
   - The game loop continues until the player closes the game window (`screen.exitonclick()`).

## paddle.py
1. Class Definition:
   - The `Paddle` class is defined, inheriting from the `Turtle` class.

2. Constructor (`__init__` method):
   - The constructor initializes the paddle's properties when an instance of the class is created.
   - The paddle is given a square shape, colored white, and stretched to have a wider width (`stretch_wid=5`) and a standard length (`stretch_len=1`).
   - The initial position of the paddle is set using the `goto` method.

3. `go_up` Method:
   - The `go_up` method is called when the player wants to move the paddle upward.
   - It calculates the new y-coordinate by adding 20 to the current y-coordinate and updates the paddle's position accordingly.

4. `go_down` Method:
   - The `go_down` method is called when the player wants to move the paddle downward.
   - It calculates the new y-coordinate by subtracting 20 from the current y-coordinate and updates the paddle's position accordingly.

The `Paddle` class encapsulates the basic behavior of a paddle in the Pong game. The paddles are designed to move up and down in response to user input, allowing players to control their positions on the screen. You can customize the appearance or movement increment by modifying the relevant parameters in the constructor or methods.
## ball.py

1. Class Definition:
   - The `Ball` class is defined, inheriting from the `Turtle` class.

2. Constructor (`__init__` method):
   - The constructor initializes the ball's properties when an instance of the class is created.
   - The ball is given a circular shape, colored red, and its initial movement speed is set to 0.1.
   - The initial movement is set in both the x and y directions with `self.x_move` and `self.y_move` initialized to 10.

3. `move` Method:
   - The `move` method updates the ball's position by adding `self.x_move` to its current x-coordinate and `self.y_move` to its current y-coordinate.
   - The new position is set using the `goto` method.

4. `bounce_y` Method:
   - The `bounce_y` method is called when the ball collides with the top or bottom wall.
   - It reverses the direction of the ball in the y-axis (`self.y_move *= -1`) and slightly increases the ball's speed by reducing `self.move_speed` by 10%.

5. `bounce_x` Method:
   - The `bounce_x` method is called when the ball collides with a paddle.
   - It reverses the direction of the ball in the x-axis (`self.x_move *= -1`).

6. `reset` Method:
   - The `reset` method is called when a point is scored, and the ball needs to be reset to the center of the screen.
   - It moves the ball to the center (`self.goto(0, 0)`), resets the movement speed to the initial value, and calls `bounce_x` to reverse the x-direction.

This class encapsulates the behavior of the ball in the Pong game, making it easy to manage its movement, collisions, and resetting. You can adjust the initial speed, colors, or shapes to customize the appearance and difficulty of your game.
## scoreboard.py
1. Constants:
   - `ALIGNMENT` and `FONT` are defined as constants for the text alignment and font style.

2. Class Definition:
   - The `Scoreboard` class is defined, inheriting from the `Turtle` class.

3. Constructor (`__init__` method):
   - The constructor initializes the scoreboard's properties when an instance of the class is created.
   - The scoreboard is set to white color, lifted the pen (so it doesn't draw while moving), and hidden (`self.hideturtle()`).
   - Initial scores for the left (`self.l_score`) and right (`self.r_score`) players are set to 0.
   - The `update_scoreboard` method is called to display the initial scores.

4. `update_scoreboard` Method:
   - The `update_scoreboard` method clears the previous scores and writes the current scores on the screen.
   - The left player's score is written at (-100, 200), and the right player's score is written at (100, 200).

5. `l_point` and `r_point` Methods:
   - The `l_point` method is called when the left player scores a point.
   - It increments the left player's score by 1 and calls `update_scoreboard` to display the updated score.

   - The `r_point` method is called when the right player scores a point.
   - It increments the right player's score by 1 and calls `update_scoreboard` to display the updated score.

The `Scoreboard` class encapsulates the functionality to manage and display the scores in your Pong game. It provides methods to update the scores, and you can easily customize the appearance of the scores by modifying the constants and methods in this class.
